# Ready Metronome

A simple, quick to launch metronome application written in Rust by Peter Wells for CS-510: Rust Programming in Fall 2023 at Portland State University.

It is built with Rodio to control the audio, Spin Sleep to ensure accurate timing and Ratatui to give it a nice Terminal UI.
